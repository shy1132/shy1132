full stack (html, css, js, node.js, best at backend stuff)  
and a little bit of lua(u)

i work on random things a lot, but i currently have 4 or so big projects that i mainly work on  
i dont usually open source my code unless it makes sense for it to be open, or im just proud of it

you can contact me by email: shy@shy.rocks  
i probably wont respond if its not anything interesting though
