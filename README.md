full stack (html, css, js, node.js/bun, best at backend stuff)  
also do lua5.1 and luau(roblox/lune)  

i work on random things a lot, i dont really have a single "main" project at any given time  
i only really open source my code if its a public service or it runs on your computer  

i like to mess with private apis, either for scraping purposes or security research

if you want to know more about my endeavors, you can read my [blog](https://blog.shy.rocks)

you also can contact me at this email: shy@shy.rocks  
i don't often check it though, and it's inbox is kind of flooded
