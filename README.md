full stack (html, css, js, node.js/bun, best at backend stuff)  
also do lua5.1 and luau(roblox)  

i work on random things a lot, i dont tend to have a "main" project, but i do have "big" projects  
i dont usually open source my code unless its a public service, or it runs on your computer  

i also like to do security research and reverse engineering private apis (if you can call it that)

you can contact me by email: shy@shy.rocks  
i probably will respond if you are nice
