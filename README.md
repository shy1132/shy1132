full stack (html, css, js, node.js/bun, best at backend stuff)  
also do lua and luau(roblox/lune)  

i only really open source my code if its a public service or it runs on your computer, but when i do open source it, i prefer the MIT license  
the MIT license is my favorite simply because anyone can use my code for whatever, oftentimes i'll find really useful code, but it's GPL, so i can't use it in my MIT licensed project  
you can use my MIT code for whatever!  

i like to mess with private apis, either for scraping purposes or security research, it's very fun to get something working in a way you're not supposed to, and it's very fun to use them over extremely limited and boring public apis...  

if you want to know more about my endeavors, you can read my [blog](https://blog.shy.rocks)

i will probably respond if i'm not feeling too shy...
